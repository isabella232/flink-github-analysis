# Github Analaysis on Flink

What can we learn from Github meta data on the use of the Flink repository?

To answer this question, we have developed a Github crawler using GraphQL and several jupyter notebooks.

This project is still a work in progress. Please let us know if you find any bugs both in the analytics and
in the code.
