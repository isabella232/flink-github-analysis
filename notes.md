# Goals

1. Investigate factors influencing conversion of first-time contributor into long-time contributors
2. Measure the health of the project in actionable metrics
3. Recognize contributors and committers

- Effect of belonging to ingroup
- Effect of work on component
- Effect of average repsonsiveness: Time between author action and action of a someone else

Output variables

- first-time contributor that came back for a second commit in the next 6 month

## Measure the health of the project in actionable metrics

- Number of active contributors
- Active contributor to committer ratio
- Average time-to-first-review
- Average PR lifetime
- Distribution of above metrics over components

## Recognize contributors and committers

- top list
- awards
- new contributors

## Additional ideas

- How many PRs are merged without review?
- Can trends in the number of PRs and reviews be mapped to events feature freezes and releases?
